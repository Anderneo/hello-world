# hello-world
This is my first repository on github
Well, what to write about me?
I'm new on programming world. So I don't know much at now, but I'm loving each step I take learning how to program.
I'm very interested in Java and Android. I can't wait to start a real Android or Java project.
Well, hope I can learn to be a good programmer and use my skills it to build something really nice and useful very soon.
